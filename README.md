# Sketch Tracker - Frontend (Drawabox Companion)

This project is a sandbox environment and streamlined habit tracker. The purpose is to facilitate and encourage consistent drawing practice. While focusing on simplicity and user-friendliness, this application also serves as a foundation for habit, health, & fitness apps in development, and is meant to be a stepping stone towards more comprehensive and user-focused tools.
