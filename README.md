# Sketch Tracker - Frontend (Drawabox Companion)

### This project is a streamlined activity tracker for users of [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) art lessons. The purpose is to facilitate and encourage consistent practice. While focusing on simplicity and user-friendliness, this application also serves as a foundation for habit, health, & fitness apps in development, and is meant to be a stepping stone towards more comprehensive and user-focused tools.
